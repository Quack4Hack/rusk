## Build system and dev environment

The build system assumes that you have at least Node.js v20.x installed. The LTS version is 20.11.1 at the time of writing.

All terminal commands assume that you are positioned in root folder of the repository.
Run `npm install` from the root folder to get the necessary dependencies.

## Environment variables

The application defines these variables by reading a local `.env`

```
# can be empty string, must start with a slash otherwise, must not end with a slash

VITE_API_ENDPOINT="https://api.dusk.network/v1"
VITE_BLOCKS_LIST_ENTRIES=100

VITE_DUSK_TESTNET_NODE="nodes.dusk.network"
VITE_DUSK_DEVNET_NODE="devnet.nodes.dusk.network"
